## What is this?

This is an introductory workshop to Node.js and Express Web Framework. 

## Why?

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open source, server-side, JavaScript platform and it has `Non-blocking event driven I/O Model` that
 gives NodeJS very attractive performance, easily beating threaded server environments like PHP and Ruby on Rails. 
 (Don't worry too much about it for now, you will understand it better through the day.)

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used web frameworks, written
in JavaScript. Express helps you to create web applications easily by providing a 
simpler interface than vanilla NodeJS for writing your server side code. 

You’re probably aware of the fact that JavaScript is the most popular programming language to write front end code, in other words, 
to have the interactivity between the user and the application, but with the invention of NodeJS,
its capabilities went far beyond that and Javascript became a full stack language from a front-end language. 


Isn't it amazing? You can create an entire website with only one language, JavaScript :heart:

## What will we be building?

We'll be building our own basic content management system (CMS) using Node.js and Express.
At the end of the workshop, you will be able to write, publish and save your blog posts using your very own platform.
If you can finish the stretch goals, you can even delete your posts or indicate a mood for a blog post :sparkles:

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. At the end of each segment, you should 
find a link to continue onto the next step. We suggest you follow along with the tutorial 
online, and write your code in a separate repository. (We are going to explain how to have a separate repository in the next step.)

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and 
paste - you will learn much more if you get into the habit of typing things out.

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar 
with. These terms are explained in the 
[Keywords](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#keywords) section at the bottom 
of each page. You'll also find a link to our cheatsheets under 
[Useful Links](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#useful-links).

## Prerequisites

Previous Javascript / Express.js / Node.js knowledge is useful but **not necessary** for this workshop. 
We have tried our best to make the workshop beginner friendly, so there isn't any assumed prior knowledge.
We are also going to be holding several lightning talk sessions during the workshop about different technical topics 
to make you more familiar to the concepts.
