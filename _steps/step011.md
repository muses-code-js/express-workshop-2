You made it!  You're awesome!

You might want to go strut about the room a bit at this point and get some high fives.  

You've earned them.

So what's next?

If you look at the menu to the right you will see that there are two more sections:

1. **Challenges**
2. **The Journey Continues**

Each **Challenge** adds new features to the app that you have to figure out how to implement.  You get given all the information you need plus some hints. There is also a solution provided for you incase you get stuck.  Also consider that your answer might be different from ours.  There are pros and cons to every approach.

[Try a challenge]('../challenge1'){: class="go-link" }

**The Journey Continues** gives you some ideas about what you could go research next on your own.  There is such much to learn and this is only the tip of the iceberg.

[Continue your Journey]('../continues'){: class="go-link" }
